# TROCAS Panel App

Code and data used in the TROCAS Panel App hosted on Heroku at https://trocasdata-1.herokuapp.com

Deployment in Heroku is done via a docker container created by [Dockerfile](Dockerfile). 
But the app can also be run locally on the notebook [trocas_pannelapp_1.ipynb](trocas_pannelapp_1.ipynb), 
after creating a conda environment with [environment.yml](environment.yml).
